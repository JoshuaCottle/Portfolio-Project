                                Life throws all sorts at us, and during hard times, we may feel hopeless and not have
                                the energy to plan for the future.
                                Things to look forward to, including fun activities, can help us cope with difficult
                                situations.
                                Making plans for things we enjoy can increase our sense of hope, which is important for
                                our mental health. Our plan could be for anything from small pleasures, like a cup of
                                tea or your favourite TV programme or dance class, to a trip with family or friends, or
                                seeing your favourite film, sports team or singer.
                                Whether it’s a small or a big one, the important thing is to plan it.
                                Decide what you’ll do, when and with who and, if needed, book it. It’s important to
                                follow your plan – and repeat.
